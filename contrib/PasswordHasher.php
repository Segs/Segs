 * Description: PasswordHasher.php is a PHP port of Projects/CoX/Common/PasswordHasher/PasswordHasher.cpp
 *              from the SEGS project. This program can be used to generate credentials based on user input
 *              via vars passed from a web client. The resultant hash and salt are in the same format as the
 *              output produced by the C++ counterpart. The credentials can be stored in the accounts table
 *              using any database implementation supported by SEGS.

    Example:
      1. Retrieve user and password supplied by web client preferably using HTTPS.
      2. Call the following to generate a salt: $sample_salt = generate_salt();
      3. Hash the combined password and salt: $hashed_pass_bytearr = hash_pass($password, $sample_salt);
      4. Insert $sample_salt and $hashed_pass_bytearr into the accounts table. Be sure to defend against
         SQL injections by escaping queries or using prepared statements.
