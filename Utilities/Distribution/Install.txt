These instructions are for building SEGS from source. If you are using pre-built binaries,
you can skip below and go to the configuration section.

* SEGS pre-requisites...

ACE:
ACE is the Adaptive Communication Environment. It is used to make portability easy for us
developers. It enables it so we do not have to mess around with proprietary network
functions under Windows and Linux and instead use one call for both platforms.
ACE can be obtained here: http://download.dre.vanderbilt.edu/

Boost:
Boost is also a set of portable C++ libraries that SEGS makes use of.
Boost can be obtained here: http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=7586

CMake:
CMake is the cross-platform make utility. It generates makefiles for multiple platforms.
It simplifies the compilation and linking of SEGS based on platform.
CMake can be obtained here: http://www.cmake.org/HTML/Download.html

PostGreSQL: 
We make use of the PostGreSQL database for account, character and persistent object storage.
PostGreSQL can be obtained here: http://www.postgresql.org/download/  

zlib:
zlib is a compression library SEGS makes use of for packing data.
zlib can be obtained here: http://www.zlib.net/

* You will also need a C++ compiler and linker of course. Visual Studio and gcc + ld are known to work.
  You are welcome to try your own compiler. Let us know if it works and we'll add it to our list
  of known good compilers.

Visual Studio Express can be obtained here: http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/express/downloads/
Visual Studio contains its own linker.

The GNU Compiler Collection can be obtained here: http://gcc.gnu.org/

The GNU linker is part of the binutils collection of tools and can be obtained here: 
http://www.gnu.org/software/binutils/

You may also be able to obtain much of this software if you are using a package manager such as Cygwin's
builtin package selection screen, apt-get, pkgsrc, portage, ports, rpm, yast, yum, etc.

* Building SEGS...
  Once you have all of the above software, you will need to obtain the SEGS source. This can be
  retrieved via SVN:  svn co https://segs.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/segs segs
  
You can use TortoiseSVN or Subversion on the command line to grab the SEGS sources.
TortoiseSVN is a GUI client that can be obtained here: http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/
Subversion can be obtained here: http://subversion.tigris.org/

Once you have obtained the source, traverse to the top-level directory and issue:

user@bleh% ccmake .

This will bring up a graphical interface where you must define your paths to the required
software defined above.

Once these paths are set, you can generate a makefile by typing the 'G' key.
If there are errors, ensure the paths to the headers and libraries are correct and try again.

cmake should have generated a makefile tailored for your system.
Exit out of the cmake interface by typing the 'Q' key.

You should now be able to use the generated makefile to compile and link SEGS.

user@bleh% make
...

If all goes well, you will have working SEGS binary(s).
(authserver only at this stage in development)

* Importing the database schemas...

You must import the database schemas into your PostGreSQL database server before SEGS
will function properly. First, you'll need to create a new database on the server named "segs".
Also, create the SEGS user and grant it access to the "segs" database you just created.
Next, we'll need to import the segs.sql file into our new database we just created. This sql
file can be found under the AdminServer/sql directory:

user@bleh% psql segs segsuser < segs.sql
...

Next, you'll need to create the SEGS GameServer database. Create another database on the server
named "segs_game". You can grant the same SEGS user permission to this database to simplify things.
You will also need to import the sql file found under the GameServer/sql directory:

user@bleh% psql segs_game segsuser < segs_game.sql

* Configuring SEGS...
1. Check if your client version is properly patched.
   - Put the calc_md5s.exe in your client directory ( the same that contains CityOfHeroes.exe ) and run it.
   - This will produce digests file, compare it's contents to required_digests that came with the server.
   - if all piggs and client exe checksum match, then proceed to step 2.
2. Extract costume.bin and supergroupColors.bin to the server's 'data' directory
   - copy pigg_extract.exe to client directory and run it.
   - from the resulting 'piggs_unbound/bin' directory copy required files to server's 'data' directory.
3. Configure the server
   - copy the configuration template from the 'config_files' directory to the location where the main SEGS binary(s)
	reside. The file name is "local_1.cfg".
   - edit the configuration file per your needs. Once everything is configured, you should have a running SEGS server.

Enjoy!
