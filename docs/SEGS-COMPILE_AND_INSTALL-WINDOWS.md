REQUIREMENTS AND NOTES
------

Below are the utilities and libraries you'll need to compile SEGS in any environment. While it may be possible to use another toolset, the C++ Tool Chain below is the only one officially supported by the SEGS team. These packages are available for both Linux or Windows via the links below:

   - **QT 5.9+** - A cross platform application framework utilized heavily by SEGS. http://download.qt.io/archive/qt/

   - **CMake 3.6+** - CMake is the cross-platform make utility. It generates makefiles for multiple platforms. https://cmake.org/download/
   - **Git** - A version control system for tracking changes in computer files and coordinating work on those files among multiple people. https://git-scm.com/download

**ADVANCED:** By default SEGS uses a local SQLite database created by `SEGSAdmin` or `dbtool`, but optionally may be configured to use another database driver by manually configuring settings.cfg. SEGS is compatible with PostGreSQL or MySQL/MariaDB. These alternate configurations are optional and unsupported. YMMV.
   - _OPTIONAL:_ PostGreSQL - http://www.postgresql.org/download/
   - _OPTIONAL:_ MySQL - http://www.mysql.org/downloads/mysql

Note that all directories mentioned in this document are always relative to the directory of your SEGS installation, and commands are meant to be run from this directory (except for the initial commands that create that directory).


INSTALL C++ TOOL CHAIN
------

**1. Installing**

Download dependencies and tools by clicking on the links listed in the Requirements section above. Make sure you download the correct version for your installation of Windows. Once downloaded, navigate to your downloads folder and run each installer.

:exclamation: NOTE: for QT, please install **mingw 32bit version**


BUILD SEGS
------

**1. Start QTCreator and Clone Git Repository**

Start QTCreator and select New Project. The _New Project_ dialog box will appear. From the list on the left, select `Import Project`, and from the middle column `Git Clone`, then press the `Choose...` button at the bottom right of the dialog window.

The dialog box will change to show the _Git Clone_ dialog, which contains configuration options for importing a project from Git.

> Git is the version control system used by the SEGS Project. SEGS uses the popular Github website to store it's git repository. More information on GitHub and working with git can be found here: https://guides.github.com/

In the new Git Clone dialog box enter in the GitHub repository for SEGS `https://github.com/Segs/Segs.git`, and select the local folder where you'd like to store  your copy of the SEGS repository.

Select `Next` to clone a copy of the SEGS repo, and when completed select `Finish` to complete this step.


**2. Configure Project**

Next, QTCreator will ask you to configuration your project. This is where you'll select which development _kit_ to use and define the paths for temporary build files.

> QTCreator uses kits to group various settings for building and running projects.

Begin by selecting MinGW 32bit.
![Project Configuration](https://segs.io/user/pages/02.developers/ProjectConfiguration.png "Project Configuration")

You may select the `Details` button next to MinGW if you'd like to customize the paths where QTCreator will store temporary build files.

Finally, click `Configure Project`.

> You may change your configuration, or select additional build options by selecting `Projects` identified by the wrench icon located at the far left of QTCreator. From here you can modify settings to build the COX Map Viewer and enable the scripting engine.

**3. Build All**

If everything went well, you'll see the SEGS file tree in the _Projects Pane_ of QTCreator.
![Projects Pane](https://segs.io/user/pages/02.developers/ConfiguredProject.png "Projects Pane")

Now, select `Build > Build All` from the menu at the top of QTCreator. The bottom half of the window will show compiling output as SEGS builds. The first time you build SEGS it may take several minutes and the output window may show hundreds of warnings, but if compiled successfully, you'll see the following in the _Compile Output_ window.
```
[100%] Built target authserver
00:00:00: The process 'cmake' exited normally.
```

PREPARE SEGS SERVER
------

After compiling, you'll need to setup your SEGS Server and Databases. You'll also need to download a specific version of the client compatible with SEGS.

In order to run SEGSAdmin, certain OpenSSL DLLs are required: `libeay32.dll` and `ssleay32.dll`. These must be placed in the directory that the `SEGSAdmin.exe` application resides, which will typically be your output directory. If you do not have them, you can download them here: https://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html. Depending on whether your system is 32-bit or 64-bit, you will either download `Win32 OpenSSL v1.0.2p Light` or `Win64 OpenSSL v1.0.2p Light`. Simply navigate to the directory you install it to, and copy/paste the necessary DLLs to the output directory.

**IMPORTANT:** You can find information on setting up and running your SEGS server by reading the README.md located in your output directory (typically `out`).  

- Don't forget! You'll need a copy of the required CoH client from Issue 0 (release) version 0.22, which can be found through various sources online, or via magnet link:
  `magnet:?xt=urn:btih:c2e7e0aa72004594337d73ae6a305242e23d815f`
