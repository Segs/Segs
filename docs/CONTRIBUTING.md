## What should I know before I get started?

### SEGS and Packages

SEGS is a large open source project with ambitious goals and a complex code base. Before contributing, please read through the entirety of this guide, as it contains important information that will help ensure that your contributions are accepted and successful.


## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs or Enhancements or Feature Requests

Bugs, Enhancements, and Feature Requests are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/).

This section guides you through submitting an issue for SEGS. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report :pencil:, reproduce the behavior :computer:, and find related reports :mag_right:.

Before creating issues, please check [this list](#before-submitting-an-issue) as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating an issue, please [include as many details as possible](#how-do-i-submit-a-good-issue). Fill out [the required template](ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md), the information it asks for helps us resolve issues faster.

> **Note:** If you find a **Closed** issue that seems like it is the same thing that you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.

#### Before Submitting An Issue

* **Check the [debugging guide](DEBUGGING_GUIDE.md).** You might be able to find the cause of the problem and fix things yourself. Most importantly, check if you can reproduce the problem [in the latest version of SEGS](http://github.com/Segs/Segs).
* **Check the [FAQs on the forum](https://forum.segs.io/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=8244)** for a list of common questions and problems.
* **Perform a [cursory search](https://github.com/Segs/Segs/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue)** to see if the problem has already been reported. If it has **and the issue is still open**, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Issue?

Bugs, Enhancements, and Feature Requests are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). When creating an issue, please provide the following information by filling in [the template](ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md).

Explain the problem or feature and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
* **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible. For example, start by explaining how you started SEGS, e.g. which command exactly you used in the terminal, or how you started SEGS otherwise. When listing steps, **don't just say what you did, but explain how you did it**. For example, if you moved your character, explain if you used the mouse, or a keyboard to move, and if you used any powers or slash commands.
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples. If you're providing snippets in the issue, use [Markdown code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines).
* **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
* **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**
* **Include screenshots and animated GIFs** which show you following the described steps and clearly demonstrate the problem. If you use the keyboard while following the steps, **record the GIF with the [Keybinding Resolver](https://github.com/atom/keybinding-resolver) shown**. You can use [this tool](http://www.cockos.com/licecap/) to record GIFs on macOS and Windows, and [this tool](https://github.com/colinkeenan/silentcast) or [this tool](https://github.com/GNOME/byzanz) on Linux.
* **If you're reporting that SEGS crashed**, include a crash report with a stack trace from the operating system, and the `crash.log` and `output.log` files from the SEGS directory. Include these reports in the issue in a [code block](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines), a [file attachment](https://help.github.com/articles/file-attachments-on-issues-and-pull-requests/), or put it in a [gist](https://gist.github.com/) and provide link to that gist.
* **If the problem is related to performance or memory**, include a screenshot of your operating system's system monitor with your report, along with the `crash.log` and `output.log`.
* **If the problem wasn't triggered by a specific action**, describe what you were doing before the problem happened and share more information using the guidelines below.
* **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to most SEGS users.
* **Cite a source demonstrating this behavior in the original CoX Servers** This is critical for showing intended behavior or output. Popular sources are https://ParagonWiki.com and https://youtube.com.

Provide more context by answering these questions:

* **Can you reproduce the problem after restarting the server and client?**
* **Did the problem start happening recently** (e.g. after updating to a new version of SEGS) or was this always a problem?
* If the problem started happening recently, **can you reproduce the problem in an older version of SEGS?** What's the most recent version in which the problem doesn't happen? You can download older versions of SEGS from [the releases page](https://github.com/Segs/Segs/releases).
* **Can you reliably reproduce the issue?** If not, provide details about how often the problem happens and under which conditions it normally happens.
* If the problem is related to working with files (e.g. opening and editing files), **does the problem happen for all files and projects or only some?** Does the problem happen only when working with local or remote files (e.g. on network drives), with files of a specific type (e.g. only JavaScript or Python files), with large files or files with very long lines, or with files in a specific encoding? Is there anything else special about the files you are using?

Include details about your configuration and environment:

* **Which version of SEGS are you using?** You can get the exact version by running `authserver -version` in your terminal.
* **What's the name and version of the OS you're using**?
* **Are you running SEGS in a virtual machine or using WINE?** If so, which VM software are you using and which operating systems and versions are used for the host and the guest?


### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to SEGS? You can start by looking through these `good-first-issue` and `wishlist` issues:

* [Good First Issue](https://github.com/Segs/Segs/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) - issues which should only require a small number of lines of code, and a test or two.
* [Wishlist issues](https://github.com/Segs/Segs/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Awishlist) - issues which should be a bit more involved than `good-first-issue` issues. These are issues that the SEGS core development team would love to implement or fix, but can't prioritize currently.

Both issue lists are sorted by total number of comments. While not perfect, number of comments is a reasonable proxy for impact a given change will have.

If you want to read about running SEGS, try the end-user [README](../Projects/CoX/docs/README.md).

#### Local development

SEGS can be developed locally by cloning the git repo to your local machine. For instructions on how to do this, see the following sections in the development [README](../README.md):


### Pull Requests

* Fill in [the required template](PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)
* Do not include issue numbers in the PR title
* Include screenshots and animated GIFs in your pull request whenever possible.
* Include thoughtfully-worded, well-structured commit messages. See the [Coding Styleguide](#coding-styleguide) below.
* Document new code based on the [Documentation Styleguide](#documentation-styleguide)
* End all files with a newline

### Coding Styleguide

1. Use spaces instead of tabs. ( Most editors allow one to set this up so 'tab' = 4 spaces )

2. The target brace style is: 
```c++
    namespace L
    {

    void exampleFunction(int params)
    {
        if (pred)
        {
            statement;
            statement;
        }
        else
        {
            while (pred) 
            {
                statement;
                statement;
            }
        }
    }

    }
```

3. Lines should be limited to 120 characters; break longer lines.
If an if statement has to be broken, use an extra tab on the continuation line e.g.
```c++
    if (very very very very very very very very very very very very
            very very long predicate)
    {
        statement; ...
```

4. In header files, reserve 2 tabs for the optional keywords virtual or static,
and reserve enough tabs for the longest return type. i.e:
```c++
    class X
    {
    public:
                        X();
                        ~X();
    virtual SomeType *  function();
    static  void        otherfunction();
    };
```

5. Use descriptive function/member names (autocompletion is your friend). Also, consider naming your variable with the following formats for consistency and readability:
```cpp
    #DEFINE     DEFINE_VAR                      // for DEFINE variables
    auto        m_member_var;                   // for member variables
    auto        s_file_scope_var;               // for file scope variables
    auto        g_global_var;                   // for global variables.
    auto        throw_away;                     // for single-use limited scope, or throwaway varables.
    QString     m_underscore_separated_words;   // underscore separate words
    int         s_dont_identify_type_in_name;   // don't identify the variable type in the name. Type may change!
    bool        g_abbrev_are_ok_if_obvious;     // abbreviations are ok, if they are obvious.
    
    // real examples from source:
    QString     m_character_description;
    bool        m_is_flying;
    uint32_t    m_experience_points;
    glm::vec3   m_pos;                          // with members m_pos.x, m_pos.y, m_pos.z;
    float       yaw;
```

6. Use spacing between binary mathematical, assignment, and ternary operators and their operands:
```cpp
    a = b + c;
    a += x * y / z;
    a = b ? c : d;
```

7. Doxygen documentation should be done in the implementation files (.cpp) and omitted from the headers. Proper and thorough documentation will enable others to better understand the intent of any code you contributed. Doxygen uses special comment syntax along with tags to accomplish this. For a definitive list of tags, please see [Doxygen tags](https://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/manual/commands.html). We prefer Qt style (`/*!*/` for multi-line and `//!` for single-line) comments. See below for various examples.
```cpp
//! This class represents an Entity
class Entity
{
    public:
        // ...
    private:
        int id; //! contains the ID of the Entity
};

/*!
 * @brief Clones an entity
 * @param[in] src source Entity to copy from
 * @param[out] dst destination Entity to copy to
 * @returns true if copy was successful and false otherwise
 */
bool clone(Entity *src, Entity *dst)
{
    // ...
    if (!Entity)
        return false;
    else
        return true;
}
```

### Documentation Styleguide

* Use [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown) whenever possible.


## Additional Notes

### Issue and Pull Request Labels

This section lists the labels we use to help us track and manage issues and pull requests. Open an issue to suggest new labels.

[GitHub search](https://help.github.com/articles/searching-issues/) makes it easy to use labels for finding groups of issues or pull requests you're interested in. For example, you might be interested in [open issues which are labeled as bugs, but still need to be reliably reproduced](https://github.com/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+user%3ASegs+label%3Abug+label%3Aneeds-reproduction) or perhaps [open pull requests which haven't been reviewed yet](https://github.com/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+is%3Apr+repo%3ASegs%2Fatom+comments%3A0). To help you find issues and pull requests, each label is listed with search links for finding open items with that label. We  encourage you to read about [other search filters](https://help.github.com/articles/searching-issues/) which will help you write more focused queries.

The labels are loosely grouped by their purpose, but it's not required that every issue have a label from every group or that an issue can't have more than one label from the same group.

Please open an issue on `Segs/Segs` if you have suggestions for new labels.
