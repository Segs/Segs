SEGS is the Super Entity Game Server. It is a free, open source (under the terms of the BSD License),
cross-platform, and object-oriented suite of protocols and services. SEGS is written in C++ and allows
developers to write MMORPG clients with a focus on the superhero-theme. These clients can easily interface
with SEGS' provided services. SEGS also facilitates common MMORPG functionality such as account and
character storage to a database, account and character retrieval from a database, secure client authentication,
client movement in a virtual world, and client chat.

SEGS currently runs under a variety of platforms including Windows, Linux, *BSD, and probably other UNIX
derivatives. SEGS also works under the x86-64/amd64 architecture.
